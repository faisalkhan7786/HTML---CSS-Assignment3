        <h2>Profile</h2>
        <p>Some cricketers' rise to the top constitutes hours of perseverance and hardwork, and others' include,
            predominantly, an abundance of talent and natural ability. Abraham Benjamin de Villiers is that player you
            create in a computer game, who has both the attributes set to maximum, and then some. De Villiers has risen
            through the ranks to become one of the world's finest batsmen, most versatile batsmen, across all formats.
            When on song, de Villiers has the ability to take any bowling attack apart with his wide array of strokes on
            either side of the wicket. If his orthodoxy is compact and aesthetically pleasing, the South African
            avant-garde's trailblazing innovation often rendered bowlers speechless.</p>

        <p>His supreme ability caught the eye of the selectors as he was fast-tracked into the national squad as a raw
            20-year-old in 2004. He made his Test debut in the home series against England in 2004 and exhibited his
            class with a sublime 52 in just his fourth innings with the bat, saving South Africa from what looked like a
            certain defeat. He also registered his first Test century in the series - a fluent 109 on his home ground in
            Centurion. In short, he'd wasted no time and had shown the world his capability immediately.</p>

        <p>Having played both as an opener and as a lower-order wicketkeeper/batsman in his first Test series, he soon
            proved his worth by amassing 460 runs in his first away tour to the Caribbean Islands in 2005. A slump in
            form ensued - de Villiers battled for runs against Australia both at home and away - he had to wait until
            the home series against West Indies in 2007-08 to again reach the three-figure mark. However, he made up for
            the lost time, spanking a fine 217 against India in Ahmedabad, the first South African player to hit a
            double ton against India</p>

        <p>It was plain sailing later on for the flamboyant right-hander as he scored runs for fun. It included a superb
            unbeaten 278 against Pakistan in Abu Dhabi in November 2010, briefly placing him at the top of the ladder
            for the highest individual score by a South African batsman before Amla's 311* at the Oval less than a year
            later.

            de Villiers continued to grow in stature and improved his batting technique such that in addition to having
            the mainstream attacking game, he developed an impenetrable defence with a karate-style back-and-across
            trigger movement, and the late-block, which could be extended into the all-important check-drive to counter
            late movement off the pitch and in the air. This non-committal technique ended up making him one of the
            finest batsmen of the age. A compact defensive technique to stave off misbehaving balls on a minefield and a
            plethora of strokes in his armory to thrash the bowlers on truer wickets - AB de Villiers, the batting
            monster, had arrived.</p>

        <p>A well-rested de Villiers made a comeback into the Test side against Zimbabwe in the Boxing Day Test in
            December 2017. He has made some commendable contributions since then, scoring invaluable (not to mention
            chanceless) runs on challenging surfaces and playing the gritty accumulator and the spine of the South
            African batting line-up in the subsequent home series against India and Australia. In the twilight of his
            career, the ever-so-versatile AB continues to be a vital cog in South Africa's batting line-up - one without
            whom, they would be a more fragile unit. With proven credentials in all conditions, pressure situations, and
            across all formats, AB de Villiers is arguably the most complete batsman of his generation.

            On May 23, 2018, with just a year to go for the 2019 World Cup, AB de Villiers announced a shock retirement
            from international cricket with immediate effect. 'After 114 Test matches, 228 ODIs and 78 T20
            Internationals, it is time for others to take over. I have had my turn, and to be honest, I am tired,' de
            Villiers said in his sign-off from international cricket.</p>
